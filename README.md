# Submission Update
I received the mail on **December 8th**, and the submission deadline was **December 9th**, which left me with very little time to complete it. 
Additionally, my **exams are ongoing**, so I couldn't finish the **'Coding Skill Test'** section. 
If I get more time, I will add this part.
